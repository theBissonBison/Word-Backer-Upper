Word Backer-Upper is a very simple program that does 2 things:
1.	Automatically saves an open word document at regular intervals so you don’t have to worry so much about pressing Ctrl-S every 5 minutes.
2.	Backs up the Word “recovery documents” folder to a secondary location regularly. Often, when Word catastrophically crashes it wipes this folder, which contains the only backups of your document if you aren’t using OneDrive. By backing it up you have extra insurance against a crash, while also allowing for a brief version history from the last day if data gets corrupted (or you just want that paragraph you deleted 30 minutes ago back without spamming Ctrl-Z and praying).
Hope you like it!
